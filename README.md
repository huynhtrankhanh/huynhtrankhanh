- I'm working on [CoqCP](https://github.com/huynhtrankhanh/CoqCP), a repository of formalized [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) proofs.
- I'm on the [Coq Team](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-team.html). Ctrl+F for my full name!
- I am familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust. I can code a well tested React app with the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react).
- I'm a former Lean user and an avid Coq user.
- I like competitive programming but I'm [not good at it](https://codeforces.com/profile/huynhtrankhanh).
- I set [some challenges](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/103581/hu%e1%bb%b3nh-tr%e1%ba%a7n-khanh) on the Code Golf Stack Exchange site.
- I operated a [small Tor relay](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/35AD2E229704BE679FDB97B36A59E11F06EBF4B8). Had to shut it down because of cost.
- I wrote large parts of [this game](https://github.com/huynhtrankhanh/Crusgkeo) on a mobile phone.
- There's a project which I can't tell you about yet. I'm working hard on it. My employer promised to open source the project soon.
